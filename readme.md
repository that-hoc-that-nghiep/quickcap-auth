# ðŸš€ Project Setup Guide

## ðŸ“‚ 1. Create the `.env` File
Before running the project, you need to create a `.env` file by copying from `.env.example`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, open the `.env` file and update the configuration values as needed.

## ðŸ“¦ 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

---

## ðŸš€ 3. Run the Project
To start the development server, use:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode.

## ðŸ“– 4. Access Swagger UI
After starting the server, you can access the API documentation at:

```
Dev: http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/swagger-ui
Prod: https://auth.quickcap.live/api/swagger-ui
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Notes
- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.
- If you encounter any issues, check the `.env` file for missing or incorrect configurations.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
